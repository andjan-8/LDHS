LDHS is the acronym for "Small Document Management System" in Swedish. Naming things is not my strong side:)

When finished it is supposed to be able to export documents in XML and LaTeX, and store them as PDF-files.

This is mostly for educational and personal purposes (I'm an IS-student and I need a document management system)
but help and tips are very welcome.
